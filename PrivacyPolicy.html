    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p>
      This privacy policy applies to the Open See AR mobile application (the "App") and governs data collection and usage. By using the App, you consent to the data practices described in this policy.
    </p>
    <h2>Collection of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      The App collects the following personal information from users:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Photos: The App allows users to upload photos to Firebase Firestore, a cloud-based database service provided by Google LLC. These photos may include personal information, such as images of people, places, or things.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Use of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses the personal information it collects to provide and improve the App's features and functionality. For example, the App may use photos to allow users to share their experiences with others or to provide personalized recommendations.
    </p>
    <h2>Sharing of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      The App may share personal information with third parties in the following circumstances:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>With your consent: The App may share personal information with third parties if you have provided your explicit consent for such sharing.</li>
      <li>With service providers: The App may share personal information with third-party service providers that perform certain functions or services on our behalf, such as hosting data or providing customer support. These service providers are contractually bound to protect the personal information they receive from us and may not use it for any other purpose.</li>
      <li>For legal reasons: The App may disclose personal information if required to do so by law or in response to a valid request by a law enforcement or government agency.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Security of Personal Information</h2>
    <p>
      The App uses reasonable security measures to protect personal information from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. However, no method of electronic storage or transmission can be 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee its absolute security.
    </p>
    <h2>Changes to this Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>
      This Privacy Policy may be updated from time to time for any reason. You are advised to consult this Privacy Policy regularly for any changes, as continued use is deemed approval of all changes.
